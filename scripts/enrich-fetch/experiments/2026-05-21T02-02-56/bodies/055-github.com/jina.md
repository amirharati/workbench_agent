siuba ([小巴](http://www.cantonese.sheik.co.uk/dictionary/words/9139/)) is a port of [dplyr](https://github.com/tidyverse/dplyr) and other R libraries. It supports a tabular data analysis workflow centered on 5 common actions:

*   `select()` - keep certain columns of data.
*   `filter()` - keep certain rows of data.
*   `mutate()` - create or modify an existing column of data.
*   `summarize()` - reduce one or more columns down to a single number.
*   `arrange()` - reorder the rows of data.

These actions can be preceded by a `group_by()`, which causes them to be applied individually to grouped rows of data. Moreover, many SQL concepts, such as `distinct()`, `count()`, and joins are implemented. Inputs to these functions can be a pandas `DataFrame` or SQL connection (currently postgres, redshift, or sqlite).

For more on the rationale behind tools like dplyr, see this [tidyverse paper](https://tidyverse.tidyverse.org/articles/paper.html). For examples of siuba in action, see the [siuba guide](https://siuba.org/guide).

## Installation

[](https://github.com/machow/siuba#installation)

```
pip install siuba
```

## Examples

[](https://github.com/machow/siuba#examples)
See the [siuba guide](https://siuba.org/guide) or this [live analysis](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eKuboGOoP08) for a full introduction.

### Basic use

[](https://github.com/machow/siuba#basic-use)
The code below uses the example DataFrame `mtcars`, to get the average horsepower (hp) per cylinder.

from siuba import group_by, summarize, _
from siuba.data import mtcars

(mtcars
  >> group_by(_.cyl)
  >> summarize(avg_hp = _.hp.mean())
  )

```
Out[1]: 
   cyl      avg_hp
0    4   82.636364
1    6  122.285714
2    8  209.214286
```

There are three key concepts in this example:

| concept | example | meaning |
| --- | --- | --- |
| verb | `group_by(...)` | a function that operates on a table, like a DataFrame or SQL table |
| siu expression | `_.hp.mean()` | an expression created with `siuba._`, that represents actions you want to perform |
| pipe | `mtcars >> group_by(...)` | a syntax that allows you to chain verbs with the `>>` operator |

See the [siuba guide overview](https://siuba.org/guide) for a full introduction.

### What is a siu expression (e.g. `_.cyl == 4`)?

[](https://github.com/machow/siuba#what-is-a-siu-expression-eg-_cyl--4)
A siu expression is a way of specifying **what** action you want to perform. This allows siuba verbs to decide **how** to execute the action, depending on whether your data is a local DataFrame or remote table.

from siuba import _

_.cyl == 4

```
Out[2]:
█─==
├─█─.
│ ├─_
│ └─'cyl'
└─4
```

You can also think of siu expressions as a shorthand for a lambda function.

from siuba import _

# lambda approach
mtcars[lambda _: _.cyl == 4]

# siu expression approach
mtcars[_.cyl == 4]

```
Out[3]: 
     mpg  cyl   disp   hp  drat     wt   qsec  vs  am  gear  carb
2   22.8    4  108.0   93  3.85  2.320  18.61   1   1     4     1
7   24.4    4  146.7   62  3.69  3.190  20.00   1   0     4     2
..   ...  ...    ...  ...   ...    ...    ...  ..  ..   ...   ...
27  30.4    4   95.1  113  3.77  1.513  16.90   1   1     5     2
31  21.4    4  121.0  109  4.11  2.780  18.60   1   1     4     2

[11 rows x 11 columns]
```

### Using with a SQL database

[](https://github.com/machow/siuba#using-with-a-sql-database)
A killer feature of siuba is that the same analysis code can be run on a local DataFrame, or a SQL source.

In the code below, we set up an example database.

# Setup example data ----
from sqlalchemy import create_engine
from siuba.data import mtcars

# copy pandas DataFrame to sqlite
engine = create_engine("sqlite:///:memory:")
mtcars.to_sql("mtcars", engine, if_exists = "replace")

Next, we use the code from the first example, except now executed a SQL table.

# Demo SQL analysis with siuba ----
from siuba import _, tbl, group_by, summarize, filter

# connect with siuba
tbl_mtcars = tbl(engine, "mtcars")

(tbl_mtcars
  >> group_by(_.cyl)
  >> summarize(avg_hp = _.hp.mean())
  )

```
Out[4]: 
# Source: lazy query
# DB Conn: Engine(sqlite:///:memory:)
# Preview:
   cyl      avg_hp
0    4   82.636364
1    6  122.285714
2    8  209.214286
# .. may have more rows
```
