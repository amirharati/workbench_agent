# Workbench Agent - Product Requirements Document

## Overview

Workbench Agent is a Chrome extension that serves as a personal productivity tool combining tab management, bookmark organization, note-taking, and an AI-powered assistant. The AI agent acts as a personal organizer, search engine, and contextual helper that can understand and work with your browsing context, notes, and resources.

## Vision

A minimal, personal tool that helps organize digital work by intelligently managing tabs, bookmarks, and notes while providing an AI assistant that understands context across browsing sessions, projects, and resources.

## Target Audience

**Primary**: Personal use by the creator
**Secondary**: Potential sharing with select individuals for feedback
**Future**: May evolve into open-source project or MVP based on interest

## Core Principles

- **Personal Tool First**: Built for personal use, not optimized for public release
- **Client-Side Processing**: No server required; AI calls made directly from client
- **Local-First**: Data stored locally with optional cloud sync/backup
- **Minimal & Simple**: Focus on core functionality, avoid over-engineering
- **Privacy-Focused**: All data stays local; cloud sync is optional

## Key Features

### 1. Tab Management
- View and organize open tabs across windows
- Group tabs by project or context
- Quick access to tab collections
- Tab search and filtering

### 2. Bookmark Management
- Enhanced bookmark organization
- Categorization and tagging
- Visual bookmark grid/collection view
- Link bookmarks to projects and notes

### 3. Note Management
- Create and organize notes
- Link notes to projects
- Associate resources (links, bookmarks) with notes
- Notes can be created:
  - Manually
  - While reading a page (with page context)
  - During browsing sessions

### 4. AI Agent Assistant

#### Core Capabilities
- **Personal Assistant**: Help organize and manage tabs, bookmarks, and notes
- **Search Engine**: Provide resources and information (e.g., "provide resources for learning TradingView")
- **Project Organizer**: Help organize notes and resources around specific projects
- **Contextual Helper**: Answer questions while reading pages with full context awareness

#### Context Awareness
The AI agent can access:
- Current page content and context
- Project-related notes and resources
- Bookmarks and saved links
- Previous notes and conversations
- Browser history context (if available)

#### Example Use Cases
- "Provide resources for learning how to use TradingView" (specific or general)
- "Organize my notes about [project name]"
- "What did I note about [topic]?"
- "Find related resources to what I'm reading"
- "Help me understand this page in context of my [project]"

### 5. Resource Linking
- Link bookmarks to notes
- Link notes to projects
- Create resource collections
- Visualize relationships between notes, bookmarks, and projects

## Technical Architecture

### Frontend
- **Framework**: React + TypeScript
- **Build Tool**: Vite
- **UI**: Minimal, clean interface focused on functionality

### Data Storage
- **Primary**: Local IndexedDB (via idb library)
- **Sync/Backup**: Optional Dropbox API integration
  - Sync notes, bookmarks, and project data
  - Backup functionality
  - Cross-device access (future)

### AI Integration
- **Architecture**: Direct API calls from client-side
- **Processing**: Client-side processing of AI responses
- **API Key**: Stored locally (personal use, security not a primary concern)
- **Endpoints**: Standard AI API endpoints (OpenAI, Anthropic, etc.)

### Chrome Extension
- **Manifest**: Chrome Extension Manifest V3
- **Service Worker**: Background processing
- **Content Scripts**: Page reading and context capture
- **Storage**: Chrome Storage API + IndexedDB
